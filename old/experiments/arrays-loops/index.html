<!-- 

This HTML file demonstrates a canvas experiment using the HTML5 <canvas> element and JavaScript. 
It includes the following features:

1. **Canvas Setup**:
    - A <canvas> element with an ID of "myCanvas" is defined, having a width and height of 600px.
    - Basic CSS styles are applied to center the canvas and add a border.

2. **Drawing on Canvas**:
    - A blue rectangle is drawn at coordinates (20, 20) with a size of 80x80 pixels.
    - A larger rectangle is outlined at coordinates (100, 100) with a size of 400x400 pixels.
    - An arc (part of a circle) is drawn with a center at (300, 300), a radius of 100 pixels, and spanning from π radians to 2π radians.

3. **Marking Points**:
    - A red dot is drawn at the starting point of the arc, calculated using trigonometric functions.

4. **Drawing a Right Triangle**:
    - A right triangle is drawn inside the circle:
      - One vertex is at the circle's center (300, 300).
      - Another vertex is at the arc's starting point (200, 300).
      - The third vertex is at a point on the horizontal line (300, 400).
    - The triangle is outlined in green and filled with a semi-transparent green color.

5. **Customization**:
    - The script uses various canvas properties such as `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, and `lineWidth` to customize the appearance of shapes.

This experiment demonstrates basic canvas drawing techniques, including rectangles, arcs, and custom shapes, as well as the use of trigonometry for precise positioning.
